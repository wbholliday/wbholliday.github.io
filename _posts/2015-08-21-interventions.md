title: Possible Behavior Interventions
permalink: /interventions/

The behavior interventions that were attempted during Russ' response to intervention did not produce a positive outcome.  Particularly, Russ backslid during the behavioral contract.  It is characteristic of students with ADHD to have poor impulse control and an inability to delay gratification ([Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder][resources]), explaining the poor performance of the behavior contract.

Random positive teacher attention, or noncontingent reinforcement, can be an effective intervention for students with ADHD.  When Russ throws an object, he can generally expect to be reprimanded, but he does not mind if he receives positive or negative attention.  When the teacher chooses when to provide positive attention, as opposed to a response to bad behavior, the link between bad behavior and attention will be broken ([Lali, et al, 1997][resources]).  Hopefully, an unprovoked nod and random approval will produce a reduction in Russ' desire to throw objects.
