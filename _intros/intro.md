After reviewing the report concerning Russ academic progress and his eligibility for Special Education Services, recommendations are offered to improve the quality of his education.  These methods are not meant to supplant the individualized education program (IEP) that Russ has received, but to work in conjunction with it.  Being that the least restrictive environment for Russ will be a general education classroom, the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) will aid in giving Russ different avenues towards educational achievement and promote a more inclusive environment.
