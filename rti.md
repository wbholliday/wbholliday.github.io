#Meet Russ Armstrong…

###a creative and active 13-year-old boy.

Russ is currently in the 8th grade and has recently completed a comprehensive evaluation to determine if he meets eligibility for Special Education services.  His teachers report through interviews and progress monitoring data that he is experiencing learning and behavioral challenges that are negatively impacting his school success. Russ has a medical diagnosis of ADHD from Dr. Doom, MD.  

Russ’ multidisciplinary team met and determined that Russ meets eligibility criteria for Special Education services through the Other Health Impairment program due to a heightened alertness to environmental stimuli that limits his ability to focus on instructional and academic tasks. This condition negatively impacts his ability to learn without the provision of specially designed instruction, supports and services. 

Russ has been removed from his biological parents’ home due to documented neglect.  He currently resides in foster care. His foster mother would like to explore alternative options for managing his behavior before resorting to medical intervention.

He appears to enjoy one on one time with adults when he is allowed to discuss topics of interest to him. He is inquisitive and likes to figure out how things work.  Russ enjoys science and enthusiastically talks about “research” that he is conducting on various topics. Academic records, teacher reports, formal class observation reports, and analyzed work samples reveal he struggles academically in all areas with the exception of science.

Russ is often impulsive especially when he sees something that appeals to him. He is fascinated by clocks and likes to take them apart. He tends to engage in lengthy, one-sided conversations on his favorite subjects and is not easily redirected until he has exhausted all of his thoughts on a particular topic. The expressiveness of his speech is often inconsistent with its content. In general, he appears to have minimal pragmatic language skills*. He has trouble following directions and frequently requires them to be repeated.

His teacher report that Russ exhibits difficulties with peer relationships and functioning in small groups. Russ frequently throws objects, hits others, and disrupts the class by talking while the teacher is addressing the whole class. Russ’ teacher believes that he has an understanding of social rules but has difficulty applying these skills. He is frequently rejected as a work partner because of his disruptive behavior. The teacher describes Russ as forgetful and says that he needs frequent reminders to stay on task in the classroom. 

According to the BASC-2 (Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition) Russ did not reveal any depressive or manic symptoms. Russ’ T score on Anxiety is 52 and has a percentile rank of 55. This T score falls in the average
classification range, and follow-up is not necessary. 

Russ’ T score on Depression is 48 and has a percentile rank of 45. This T score falls in the average classification range, and follow-up is not necessary.

Hearing and Vision are within normal limits – 01/15/2014  Russ passed screenings with the school nurse.

Lexile score: 750, January 2014

##Intervention Summary; January 2014  – Russ Armstrong

##Behavioral Interventions

###Tier 2 Interventions : Weeks 1-8

Russ participated in an after school study and homework club. 5 days a week; one hour sessions

###Tier 2 Interventions: Weeks 8-16

Russ received formal instruction on self management of behavior via a social skills group with the school counselor.  The school counselor provided structured instruction on academic stress, effective student / teacher communication, bullying, depression, and negative peer pressure, 3 times a week; 45 minute sessions

###Tier 3 Interventions: Weeks 16-24

The teacher rated Russ on his behavior (hands and objects to self) every hour using a scale of 3-2-1 (3 means everything went extremely well that hour, 2 means things went well but could have been a little better , and 1 means things could have been better). For each ‘3’ Russ was allowed a to play from a predetermined selection of educational web-sites for 15 minutes. 

A Special Education teacher explicitly taught, modeled and rehearsed executive skills with Russ 3 days a week; 15 minute sessions.

A Functional Behavioral Assessment was conducted by Russ’ Student Support Team. The current hypothesis is that Russ throws objects to get a teacher’s attention.

The team concluded - When Russ has a task to complete independently, he throws objects and / or hits others. This results in individualized counseling sessions with Russ by a teacher.

##Academic Interventions

###Tier 2 Interventions : Weeks 1-8

Corrective Reading is designed to promote reading accuracy (decoding), fluency, and comprehension skills of students in grades 4–12 who are reading below their grade level. The program includes four sequential levels that address students’ decoding skills and six sequential levels that address students’ comprehension skills. The levels are designed to target students who need assistance with particular types of reading skills based on the results of Corrective Reading placement test. The decoding and comprehension components can be used separately as a supplemental reading intervention or combined for use as a reading intervention curriculum. All lessons in the program are sequenced and scripted. Corrective Reading can be implemented in small groups of four to five students or in a whole-class format. Corrective Reading is intended to be taught in 45-minute lessons four to five times a week.

###Tier 2 Interventions: Weeks 8-16

Fast ForWord® is a computer-based reading program intended to help students develop and strengthen the cognitive skills necessary for successful reading and learning. The program, which is designed to be used 30 to 100 minutes a day, five days a week, for 4 to 16 weeks, includes two components. The first component, the Fast ForWord® Language2 and Literacy3 series, aims to build cognitive skills such as memory, attention, processing, and sequencing, as well as language and reading skills, including listening accuracy, phonological awareness, and knowledge of language structures. The second component, the Fast ForWord® to Reading4 series (also known as the Fast ForWord® Reading series), aims to increase processing efficiency and further improve reading skills such as sound-letter associations, phonological awareness, word recognition, knowledge of English language conventions, vocabulary, and comprehension. The program, developed by scientists with expertise in the areas of brain plasticity, cognitive development, and reading instruction, is designed to adapt the nature and difficulty of the content based on individual students’ responses.

###Tier 3 Interventions: Weeks 16-24

Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction is a reading comprehension instructional program for grades 3–9 that integrates reading and science through activities and the use of science books during reading instruction  The program supplements a school’s standard science and reading curricula and offers instruction in reading strategies, scientific concepts, and inquiry skills. Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction intends to improve reading comprehension and increase reading engagement. The program aims to improve comprehension by teaching students the following strategies that they can use to better understand text they are reading (1) activating background knowledge, (2) questioning, (3) searching for information, (4) summarizing, (5) organizing graphically, and (6) identifying story structure. The program aims to increase student engagement in reading through five practices: (1) using content-area goals for a conceptual theme during reading instruction, (2) giving students choices and control over their reading topics, (3) providing hands-on activities, (4) using interesting texts for instruction, and (5) organizing opportunities for students to collaborate and learn from text. Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction is based on the rationale that when readers are fully engaged in reading, they comprehend better, use reading strategies effectively, and are motivated to read. The developers of this intervention integrated science inquiry with reading, as this has been shown to increase both reading and science comprehension.
